# Caching

This project is designed to explore and implement various caching algorithms as a part of my backend development course. Caching is a crucial technique used to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area, reducing the need for repeated calculations or data retrieval from slow sources.

## Background Context

Caching algorithms are essential for optimizing performance in computing systems. Understanding different cache replacement policies helps in selecting the most suitable algorithm based on specific use cases and requirements. This project covered the following cache replacement policies:

  - FIFO (First In, First Out).

  - LIFO (Last In, First Out).

  - LRU (Least Recently Used).

  - MRU (Most Recently Used).

  - LFU (Least Frequently Used).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I was be able to:

  - Explain what a caching system is and its purpose.

  - Define and differentiate between FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU cache replacement policies.

  - Describe the limits and constraints of caching systems.
